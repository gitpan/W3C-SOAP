=head1 NAME

W3C::SOAP::XSD::Traits - Specifies the traits of an XSD Moose attribute

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to W3C::SOAP::XSD::Traits version 0.01.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use W3C::SOAP::XSD::Traits;

   # Brief but working code example(s) here showing the most common usage(s)
   # This section will be as far as many users bother reading, so make it as
   # educational and exemplary as possible.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines the Moose attribute trait C<W3C::SOAP::XSD>. This specifies a number
of properties that an attribute can have which helps the processing of
objects representing XSDs.

=over 4

=item C<xs_perl_module>

If the attribute has a type that is a perl module (or a list of a perl module)
This parameter helps in the coercing of XML nodes to the attribute.

=item C<xs_min_occurs>

This represents the minimum number of occurrences of elements in a list.

=item C<xs_max_occurs>

This specifies the maximum number of occurrences of elements in a list.

=item C<xs_name>

This is the name as it appears in the XSD

=item C<xs_type>

This is the type as it appears in the XSD (this will be translated
to perl types/modules specified by the isa property)

=item C<xs_choice_group>

If a complex element has choices this records the grouping of those
choices.
