=item schema

A common class is created that represents the whole schema, this class includes
all other classes that are created. The attributes of this class are the
C<xs:element>s of the XSD

=item xs:element

These are mapped to attributes of the XSD

=item xs:simpleType

These are mapped to MooseX::Types and located in the {BaseClass}::Types module.
They then need to be imported into modules that need them.

=item xs:complexType

These are mapped to Moose classes under the {BaseClass} namespace
