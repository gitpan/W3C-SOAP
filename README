W3C-SOAP

This package is aimed at creating SOAP clients from WSDL files. It does this
by parsing WSDL and XSD files/URLs to generate Perl Moose objects that can
be use to talk to the SOAP web service. The generated Perl objects are
generated to follow Perl best practices syntax (eg camel case names are
converted to underscore seperated attributes/methods where appropriate. If
MooseX::Aliases is available and the appropriate configured option passed the
raw names will also be available to used.)
