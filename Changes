        Don't try to load dynamically created modules
        Style cleanup
        fully qualify operation in SOAPAction header NB some soap servers require the SOAPAction to be fully qualified e.g. http://www.xmlme.com/WSShakespeare.asmx?WSDL REQ: SOAPAction: "GetSpeech" RES: SoapException: Server did not recognize the value of HTTP Header SOAPAction: GetSpeech http://ws.cdyne.com/ip2geo/ip2geo.asmx?wsdl REQ: SOAPAction: "ResolveIP" RES: <faultstring>Server did not recognize the value of HTTP Header SOAPAction: ResolveIP http://www.ebob42.com/cgi-bin/NumberToWordsInDutch.exe/wsdl/IDutch REQ: SOAPAction: "NumToStr" RES: <faultstring>No interface registered for soap action '"NumToStr"'</faultstring>
        Style clean up and adding missing semi colon
        Furthered Danny's to includes and added descriptive warning so any problems can be more easily debugged
        don't have import fallback to namespace when there's no schemaLocation otherwise on sharepoint 2010, this <s:import namespace="http://microsoft.com/wsdl/types/" /> results in Could not create file parser context for file "http://microsoft.com/wsdl/types/": Resource temporarily unavailable I'm guessing that import is just for the namespace when the contents have been merged in
